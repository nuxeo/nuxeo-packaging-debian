Description: Full-featured document management server and platform
 Nuxeo is a document management server, designed to help organizations
 better manage their digital content (documents, images, videos, etc.). It
 provides an approachable and cost effective alternative to mainstream
 proprietary, resource-intensive offerings for document management.
 .
 Its main features include: metadata/taxonomies, versioning, lifecyle
 management, workflow, relations, searching, reporting, transformation,
 auditing, retention and content automation.
 .
 Nuxeo is already used by many large companies and public sector
 organizations to manage up to hundreds of millions of documents.
 .
 Its graphical interface is web-based, allowing user to work with just a simple
 web browser. Various APIs, including web services and REST APIs, allow
 developers and systems integrators to use the Nuxeo platform to build vertical
 business application for their own customers needs.
 .
 Thanks to its plugin system, it can be extended with additional technical and
 business features.
